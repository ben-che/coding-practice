// Given an array, you must increment any duplicate elements until all its elements are unique. In addition,
// the sum of its elements must be the minimum possible within the rules. For example, if arr = [3, 2, 1, 2, 7],
// then arr = [3, 2, 1, 4, 7] and its elements sum to a minimal value of 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 7 = 17.
